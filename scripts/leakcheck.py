"""leakcheck: keep internal identifiers and credentials out of a PUBLIC repo.

This file is IDENTICAL in every public RunOS repo (nodeagent, clusteragent,
desktop, cli). Do not fork it. Change it here, then copy it across and bump
LEAKCHECK_VERSION so drift is visible in a diff.

WHERE IT RUNS
-------------
1. .github/workflows/leakcheck.yml   every push and every pull request. This is
                                     the gate that stands between a commit and
                                     GitHub, and nobody can skip it.
2. .githooks/pre-commit              opt-in per clone (`make hooks`), skippable
                                     with --no-verify. Fast feedback only.
3. scripts/release.sh                the release gate. It runs after the branch
                                     is already pushed, so it is a last check,
                                     not the first one.

It has no dependency beyond python3 and git.

TWO SEVERITIES
--------------
1. credential  Hard fail, always. Never baselineable. Same shapes as the
               SECRET_RE floor in scripts/release.sh, so behaviour matches.
2. internal    Ratcheted, like a knip dead-code baseline. A finding already
               listed in the baseline file passes. A NEW finding fails. The
               baseline only shrinks unless a human runs --update.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN INTERNAL IDENTIFIER
-------------------------------------
* Named lab machines and rented boxes, and account ids, both read from
  scripts/leakcheck.config.
* IP address literals, by ALLOW-LIST, not deny-list. You cannot tell a real
  address from an invented one by looking at it, so only the ranges that are
  reserved for writing about (documentation, loopback, link-local, unspecified,
  broadcast, well-known multicast) pass unasked. Everything else, RFC1918
  included, is ratcheted: a pasted lab address is caught, and a project
  constant such as a service CIDR is absorbed into the baseline once and never
  asked about again.

MODES
-----
  leakcheck.py                     scan every tracked file (the authoritative mode)
  leakcheck.py --staged            scan only added lines in the staged diff (pre-commit)
  leakcheck.py --range A..B        scan only added lines in a commit range
  leakcheck.py --paths F [F...]    scan the named files (used by the tests)
  leakcheck.py --update            rewrite the baseline from a full tree scan
  leakcheck.py --version           print the checker version

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage or environment error.

# `runos_pat_` passed `make leakcheck` clean in all five public repos, while a
# GitHub token on the line above it failed. The pattern requires the full
# id-dot-secret shape, so a doc placeholder like `runos_pat_<id>.<secret>` does
# not trip it. No public repo contained the string at all when this was added,

    without a word. That is a hole, not a safeguard, and it was measured: a real

    leading NUL bytes all passed `leakcheck: clean` with exit 0, while the SAME
