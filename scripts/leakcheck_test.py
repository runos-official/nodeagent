"""Tests for leakcheck.

This file is IDENTICAL in every public RunOS repo. Run it with:

    make leakcheck-test          (or: python3 scripts/leakcheck_test.py)

IMPORTANT, and it is the reason this file looks the way it does. This is a
PUBLIC repo, so the test must not itself publish the things it tests for. No
real internal identifier is ever written as a literal here. Every one is
assembled at run time from fragments that leakcheck cannot match, so this file
is clean when leakcheck scans the tree. Fixtures that need a harmless address
use the RFC 5737 documentation ranges.
